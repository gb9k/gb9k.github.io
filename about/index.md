## Aloha!

I'm not an engineer or a machinist, just some guy that likes to make fun stuff. Almost everything you see here is made in a tiny one car garage. It's relatively easy for the tinkerer to learn whatever, whenever, and with next to no money spent on software. The only constraint is time, and given enough time anyone can make anything.

Speaking of which, most of my free time is spent learning some new thing in programming, CAD/CAM, or hardware design. I love taking on multidisciplinary projects, learning everything there is to know about each facet, and hand crafting each detail to perfection.

## Resources For Getting Started

### Programming

* [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com): Introductory Programming
* [Atom](https://atom.io/): Hackable Text Editor
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): DIY Static Webpage

### CAD/CAM

* [Fusion 360](http://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview): Free CAD/CAM for hobbyists/small business.
* [Eagle CAD](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/freeware/): Free CAD for PCB design.
* [123D Circuits](https://123d.circuits.io): Simulate Breadboard prototypes with code. Afterwards, turn the prototype into a PCB that can be purchased.
* [ecad.io](https://www.ecad.io): Convert Electrical CAD drawings to Mechanical CAD. Great for bringing EagleCAD projects into Fusion 360.
