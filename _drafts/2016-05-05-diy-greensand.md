# In the beginning, there was play sand

So, I really want to melt metal, and after watching a  [plethora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHD10DjxM1g) of [youtubers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f10hqYGIJCE) I was off to the races and melting down aluminum cans like a beast. There's only one problem, what do I do with my newly acquired buckets of metal ingots? Cast stuff!

In the early days, most mainstream tutorials would talk about lost foam casting in regular play sand. The steps were pretty much:

1. Make a styrofoam model by hand
2. Attach a styrofoam sprue to the top
3. Bury that model in play sand, leaving the sprue exposed
4. Poke vents in the sand for exhaust gases to escape
5. Pour in your aluminum and hope you melted enough
6. Profit!

If you want to cast the same thing multiple times, then lost foam may not be for you. For that, wooden or plastic patterns may be what you're looking for. It is here our problem is exposed, regular play sand will collapse after removing our wooden pattern. What we need is greensand!

# Prepping Our Playsand

To make 10L of greensand we will need:

1. 50lb bag of Playsand
2. Fine mesh flour sifter (the larger the better)
3. 3 recepticles, one each for pre-staged filtered, coarse, and measured out sand.
4. Sacrificial measuring cup to 1L
5. A really long Spotify playlist

That's right, that 50lb bag of sand will sift down to about 9L of semi-suitable playsand. ![50 pound bag of playsand]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DIY_Greensand/PlaySand.jpg "So much sand!")
