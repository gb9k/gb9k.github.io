# The Two Speakers

Two speakers were given ten minutes each to deliver a speech on the reasons for backing their candidate. Here's a quick summary:

## Sanders

Senator Sanders has been involved with civil rights since he was 20 years old, backed marriage equality even when it was unpopular, fought for universal healthcare from the beginning, and wants to make higher ed available to all. His actions line up with his convictions, he has your best interests at heart and that's why you should vote for Bernie.

## Clinton

I am a gay black female veteran and that's why you should vote Hillary.

# Wait, what?!

I really wish I was kidding about this, but that's essentially what I took away from the Clinton speaker. I didn't catch who was speaking for either side since the sound is really bad.
